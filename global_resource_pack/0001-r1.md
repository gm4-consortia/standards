## Overview
1. File Structure and Content Standard (`GRP-0001`) lays out the format for the contents and structure of files in the optional, `CustomModelData`-driven resource pack.
2. The resource pack is one pack for all Gamemode 4 modules.
3. All features must work in vanilla Minecraft.
	
## Technical Notes
1. File structure [`O2`]
   1. All Gamemode 4 textures and models should be under the namespace `gm4`.
2. File content [`O2`]
   1. Models must...
      1. Be correctly formatted; not one-line.
   2. Textures must...
      1. Fit the vanilla 'feel'.
      2. Keep whatever resolution the affected file is by default; for example, blocks and items are 16x16.
      3. Be approved by the Gamemode 4 admins prior to addition.
   3. `CustomModelData`/`custom_model_data` values should be kept per-model; for example, if `Item A` has a CMD defined at 1, `Item B` can have a CMD defined at 1 as well, not 2.
