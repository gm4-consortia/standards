## Overview
1. File Content Standard (`GEN-0001`) lays out the format for the content in the files for all standards.
2. All standard files state what category they affect.
3. The standard number is based off of what category is affected.
4. Both `Overview` and `Technical Information` follow the format of an indent for each sub-note.
5. Every standard documentation terminates at `END OF STANDARD`.
5. This layout must be followed in every standard's documentation.


## Technical Information
1. Standard Number [`O2`]
   1. The first three letters define the area of effect

   2. The standard ID after follows a 4-digit pattern
      1. Each iteration is sequential for each further addition starting at `0001`.
      2. The length of all IDs is 4.
      3. All other numbers are placeholdered with a 0 if unused - as in `0001` or `0274`.
2. Categories [`O2`-`O3`]
   1. In the template...
      1. Replace `category` with the full category name in lowercase-underscore format; for example, `general` or `the_end`.
      2. Replace `Category` with the full category name in upper-sentence case; for example, `General` or `The End`.
      3. Replace `CAT` with a category's ID (found at `T-1.1`).
      4. Replace `STID` with the standard's base numerical ID; for example, `0001` or `0274`.
      5. Replace `#` in `r#` with the standard's revision number
      6. Replace `#` in `O#` with the overview point number referenced
      7. Any file extensions (such as `.md`) or markdown formatting do not need to be changed
      8. Last updated date format follows [`ISO-8601`](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
3. Format layout [`O5`]
   1. The template can be found at `standards:master/template/standard.md`.
