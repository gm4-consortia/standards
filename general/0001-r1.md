## Overview

2. All standard files state what category they affect.
3. The standard number is based off of what category is affected.
4. Both `Overview` and `Technical Information` follow the format of an indent for each sub-note.
5. Every standard documentation terminates at `END OF STANDARD`.
5. This layout must be followed in every standard's documentation.
